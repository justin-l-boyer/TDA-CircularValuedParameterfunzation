# TDA-IdentifyPeriod
Use persistent cohomology and time delay embedding to identify and visualize periods in time series

## Dependencies
 - Dionysus 
 - Python 2.7

## How to
If you are interested in using this pipeline first get Dionysus up and running, then go thru http://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/examples/cohomology.html#cohomology-parametrization with a simple test set (circle perhaps) to be sure your build of Dionysus is working.  From there my pipeline should work, I reccommend starting with the jupyter notebook to get a feel for things.
